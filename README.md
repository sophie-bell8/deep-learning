# Deep Learning Assignment
Deep_Learning_Assignment refers to a project completed at university, in which i compare various preset deep learning models and design one of my own. This included tuning hyperparameters and creating various layers. The paper submitted in conjunction with this code aimed to investigate the models, but the priority was to demonstrate my understanding of deep learning. 
The dataset used was the ISIC dataset with 9 categories of skin cancer. The models aim to classify these images. 
Overall, i achieved 80% in this assignment.
